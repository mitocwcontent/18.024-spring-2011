Textbook
--------

Apostol, Tom M. _Calculus 1, One-Variable Calculus, with an Introduction to Linear Algebra_. Waltham, Mass: Blaisdell, 1967. ISBN: 9780471000051.

———. _Calculus, Vol. 2: Multi-Variable Calculus and Linear Algebra with Applications to Differential Equations and Probability_. Wiley, 1969. ISBN: 9780471000075.

Prerequisites
-------------

[_18.01 Single Variable Calculus_](/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2005) or equivalent and permission of the instructor.

Description
-----------

We will cover the same material as [_18.02 Multivariable Calculus_](/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-spring-2006) but with an emphasis on proofs and conceptual understanding rather than computation. In addition, we will cover many topics from linear algebra that are not considered in 18.02.

Recitation Assignments
----------------------

In addition to the problem sets, there will be problems assigned for each recitation. Students should be prepared to participate in the discussion and present their solutions during the specified recitation.

Problem Sets
------------

Problem sets are assigned weekly, and due the following week. There will be 12 problem sets during the semester. At the end of the course, the lowest pset grade will be dropped.

Exams
-----

There will be two in-class, one-hour midterm exams, and one three-hour comprehensive final exam.
